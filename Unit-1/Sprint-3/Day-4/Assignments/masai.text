My personal opinion on Masai School is that it is a institute which provide professional education and hard skills and for this students have not pay any money until they  don't get a job.And there is curriculum of 11 to 11 and6 in Masai School.

My personal experience in Masai Shcool is that i joined Masai school web-26 in 23 January 2022. But it was very new for me as well as my background was mechanical engineering so it was tough for me. But i was curious to learn and  i did much hard work and i performed well in that unit but unfortunately i was terminated in the unit movement. But i took it positive because i knew that i learn lot of things in 5 week. And after that again i joined web-27 batch and  now i am feeling that it is to easy for me to move in next unit.
